## Building

Don't believe it fits 13 kilobytes? Open `build.sh`, replace `compiler.jar` with a path to the Closure Compiler, and run the script. It should produce a zip file with size 11.7 kilobytes. Magic!

## Libraries used

Just this one: https://github.com/mneubrand/jsfxr

It was pretty nice, I recommend it for js13k-like projects.
